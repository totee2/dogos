This is a project to facilitate the adoption of dogs in public shelters.

The files in this project do all the data preparation so that the website just needs to read and show them.

First, the data is prepared such that it is usable by the the Machine Learning algorithm.

Then, the ML algorithm is trained on the given data.

Finally, the query script provides the possibility to query the model with a given input.

All those scripts run independently, as long as the necessary data are provided (e.g. a model and data have to be provided for the query stage).
